# Semester-project-2

Home Auction Website
Project Overview

This project is a front-end application for an auction website, designed as part of a semester exam. The website allows users to add items for auction and bid on items other users have listed. New users receive 1000 credits upon joining, which can be used for bidding on items or increased by selling items. The application integrates with an existing API to handle all back-end functionality, focusing solely on providing a seamless and engaging user experience for auction participants.
